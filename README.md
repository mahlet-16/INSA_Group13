🇪🇹 Ethiopian National ID Access Control System
📖 What is this?
A unified access control system that uses Ethiopia's mandatory National ID as a universal pass for schools, workplaces, government buildings, and other secure facilities. Think of it as "one ID, everywhere access" with smart security.

🎯 Why do we need this?
Security: Prevent unauthorized people from entering restricted areas
Efficiency: No more multiple cards/passes - just your National ID
Tracking: Real-time monitoring of who enters where and when
Safety: Instant alerts for security breaches or blacklisted individuals

🔧 How it works

Scan your National ID at any entrance
System checks your permissions for that location
Access granted/denied based on your role and schedule
Activity logged for security monitoring
National ID → Scanner → Permission Check → Access Decision → Activity Log
